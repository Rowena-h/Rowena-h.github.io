I am a PhD student in my final few months at RBG Kew and Queen Mary University of London, where I have been researching the diversity and evolution of plant-associated fungi.

My main research interests and expertise lie in using evolutionary genomics approaches to explore questions around fungal lifestyle evolution and plantâ€“fungal interactions.
