I'm a computational biologist who works on the diversity and evolution of fungi. As of January 2023 I'm a [postdoctoral researcher at the Earlham Institute](https://www.earlham.ac.uk/profile/rowena-hill), prior to which I completed my PhD at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Queen Mary University of London.

My main research interests and expertise lie in using evolutionary genomics approaches to explore questions around fungal lifestyle evolution and plantâ€“fungal interactions.
