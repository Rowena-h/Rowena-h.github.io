I'm a computational biologist who works on the diversity and evolution of fungi. I submitted my PhD at RBG Kew and Queen Mary University of London in December 2022, and start as a postdoc at the Earlham Institute in January 2023.

My main research interests and expertise lie in using evolutionary genomics approaches to explore questions around fungal lifestyle evolution and plantâ€“fungal interactions.
